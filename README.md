# Pokemon-Api


## About
This repository is a .NET Console Application that consumes the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) using RestSharp for study purposes.


## How to Use
Open the console and navigate to the main folder of the project. Then use command:

```
dotnet restore
```
Then, after restoring all the dependencies, use:

```
dotnet run
```

Then the program will ask for a Pokemon name and after that will return certain parameters of the response provided by the API.
